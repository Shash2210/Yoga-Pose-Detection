# PosePerfect - Yoga Pose Classification and Correction

## Introduction
The "Pose Perfect" project is an innovative application that leverages Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Tkinter to classify and correct yoga poses. The project aims to help users perform yoga asanas accurately by providing real-time feedback and corrections.

## Features
- **Pose Classification**: Utilizes CNN to accurately classify various yoga poses from live camera inputs or pre-recorded videos.
- **Pose Correction**: Analyzes the detected poses and provides visual guidance on how to correct them.
- **User Interface**: Offers a user-friendly interface using Tkinter to display the input pose, predicted asana, and the correct way to perform the asanaâ€”all in a single window.
- **Real-Time Feedback**: Provides instant feedback to help users improve their yoga practice.

## Usage
- Clone Repository: Clone the repository to your local machine.
- Install Dependencies: Ensure you have the required libraries installed (OpenCV, Keras, TensorFlow, Tkinter, etc.).
- Run Application: Execute the main script to launch the application.
- Yoga Pose Classification: Observe the classification of yoga poses through the webcam or uploaded videos.
- Pose Correction: View the correct way to perform the asana, with real-time feedback displayed on the interface.

## Dependencies
- **OpenCV**: Used for image capture and processing.
- **Keras**: Employed to implement the CNN model for pose classification.
- **TensorFlow**: Backend framework utilized by Keras for neural network computations.
- **Tkinter**: Used for creating the graphical user interface.
